            <h3>    Insight : <br>
                1. Almost every year, the highest revenue comes from the Female gender. However, in certain years such as 2014 and 2016, 
                there was a decrease in Female gender revenue. In 2013 - 2016, Female gender had low of total orders. <br>
                2. In 2011 - 2013, the Product_Category with the highest revenue was Bikes. However, in 2014 and 2016
                 the Product_Category 'Accessories' became the highest revenue category. As a result of: <br>
                    a. In 2011 until June 2013 the Product_Category contained Bikes only. <br>
                    b. In July 2014 and December 2016 Product_Category contaiend only two categories there are (Clothing dan Accessories). <br>
                    c. In 2014 August until December there was no sales at all. <br>
                    d. January-June 2015 the Product_Category contained bikes only.<br>
                So, there is a pattern, 30 months (Bikes) - 13 months (3 Pc) - 1 months (2 pc) - 5 months (hiatus) - 6 months (Bikes) - 7 months (3 pc) - 1 months (2 pc). <br><br>

                5. The highest order is obtained by the  Male Gender in the Product_Category Accessories among the Adults age group(35-64). <br><br>
             
                Recommendation : <br>
                1. To achieve high revenue, promotions/product innovations are targeted specifically towards Females among Adult age group (35-64). <br>
                2. However, to increase total_orders, can be focused towards the Product_Category Accessories, targeting the Male gender among the Adult age group (35-64). </h3>
